# Blog Tutorials

A handful of scripts and notebooks I offer as part 
of my personal blog at [Strakul's Thoughts](https://http://strakul.blogspot.com).

These posts in particular use the notebooks in this repo:

 - [Data Science: Python Dataclasses and MongoDB](https://strakul.blogspot.com/2019/05/data-science-python-dataclasses-and.html)
 - [Data Science: Astronomy FITS Headers in MongoDB](https://strakul.blogspot.com/2019/06/data-science-astronomy-fits-headers-in.html) 

If GitHub has issues displaying the notebook, you can paste the URL into [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to render it there.
