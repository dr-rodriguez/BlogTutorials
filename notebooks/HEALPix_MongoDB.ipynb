    "# MongoDB Cone Searches with HEALPix\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will go over how you can implement simple astronomical cone searches using HEALPix in a NoSQL database. We'll use MongoDB and the `BrownDwarf` collection we created in the [first tutorial](https://strakul.blogspot.com/2019/05/data-science-python-dataclasses-and.html). Now, MongoDB *does* have spatial indexing capabilities, but we'll go over those in a future post. In this case, we will assume we don't know or can't use these and thus build our own way to quickly search for objects using sky coordinates. A shorter write up of this tutorial is also available in [my blog](https://strakul.blogspot.com)."

    "HEALPix stands for Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelisation and is an algorithm for dividing up the sky in equal-area pixels. This is in contrast to other algorithms like HTM, Hierarchical Triangular Mesh, which divide up the sky in triangles of equal-length. We'll stick to HEALPix since it's used as the basis for several IVOA standards like MOC and HiPS. There are two main Python packages for working with HEALPix- `healpy` and `astropy-healpix`. For simplicity, I'll only use the later code here. For more details, refer to the documentation."

That does mean that objects closer than my resolution will be inside the same pixel. For practical applications, you'll probably want a resolution comparable to your PSF or instrument pixel size.\n",

We then updated our existing MongoDB database to contain this HEALPix values and built a simple cone search function that queries the database for a user supplied set of coordinates. Now, there are other ways to break up the sky, such as HTM, and more compact ways to represent regions with HEALPix, such as MOC. We're not covering those at the moment. Finally, before you go out and populate large databases with HEALPix values, I'd like to note that MongoDB has built-in spatial functionality. Setting that up takes a bit of time, and you'll have to do some extra conversions for astronomical work, but I hope to present a future tutorial going over MongoDB's geospatial queries."
